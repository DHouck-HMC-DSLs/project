***Alex's Critique 

I couldn't find much info on your project, just the language details and implementation file. 

So I guess I would say it might be helpful to just think through some sample inputs and outputs
that your program might handle. This would not only help me and others understand what kind of 
flexibility you want your DSL to have, but it would also help you nail down plans for the future. 

Another concern I have is that this might just end up being a function. I can't really imagine how 
a user has much expressibility in what they are choosing to do. Is most of the work in this 
project the conversion to an ebook? What choices does the user have?
