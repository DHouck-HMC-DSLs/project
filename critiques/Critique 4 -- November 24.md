# Project Documents
Don't worry so much about the scope of the project! I think what you are doing so far is good progress -- that you are doing _something_ to meet the goals of your plan each week. Prof. Ben talked about this at the beginning of the project, do not worry so much about whether you have a completely functional language. The important part is that you learn something about language design and created a language that captures ideas beyond just implementation. I think the most important thing is to allocate more of your time building out small parts of your language and to spend more time on the project overall :-)

Get started coding! You may have design choices that you later realize are too difficult to implement. :-( Remember that languages _do_ make compromises because of implmentation difficulty (or impossibility). These compromises may not be so visible until you start putting together the language.

Nice stretch goals! Yeah, from what it sounds like from the rest of your evaluation, you probably won't hit your other stretch goals. And that's okay because that's the point of stretch goals (thinking through the implementation of current features in a way that makes future feature additions easier).

Awesome to hear that you are still optimistic about your project! Cool - I look forward to seeing your finished project :-)
