## Additional critique for missing a monday class

## Your Description

Since we don't have any examples or code for your DSL yet, I think it is really important to
atleast have a README or something that just explains your domain and what your language is 
trying to do. I think its almost impossible to understand your description file without having
a high level understanding of what is being described. 

I get from looking at other files you have written (which aren't organized, hard to find the 
info I want to find) that you are taking files and pages from the internet and saving them to
a local computer. The thing I don't understand from your description is how the user is involved
in this process. 

I get the feeling that you are unsure of what information you want the user to give at this point
but I think that is a major part of just defining what you want the DSL to be and its scope. 
In the description I feel you should give an understanding of what the DSL will do but also how
the user interacts with it. The second part is why I feel like I don't really understand what the
DSL is truly trying to accomplish. You might go on in the other documents to describe these things 
in great detail, but for me I can't really understand it because my mind is trying to fill in that 
first hole still.

## Take away

Like I said in my last critique, the most important thing for you to do right now is come up with examples.
Even if you don't want to design a syntax yet (though you should), it would be really important to just give a use case of 
your language, basically a scenario in which someone would use it, how they would use it, and what the 
DSL would return to them. I think this might also be why you are having a hard time starting on the
implementation. If you have solid examples of what a user would want to accomplish with your DSL, that 
will shape the syntax of the language. Thinking about a complicated system theoretically will have you
thinking in circles. 

I want to comment on the other parts that you have described, but the lack of actual use cases makes it impossible
for me to visualize what is happening.
